# Background
Solo pilots perform routine checks on their vehicles to ensure the safety of their travels. 
However, it is easy to miss items on the list when working alone. Pilots often bring a buddy
to read their list as they manually check the plane. With CheckMate, I wanted to make sure no
pilot feels alone during preflight or shutdown. CheckMate is a checklist companion that allows 
pilots to store any checklist for any plane in their pockets, and to have a voice-activated
assistant both read and confirm item completion with the pilot's verbal response. Say goodbye
to run-up anxieties, because you cannot miss an item when CheckMate is onboard!
